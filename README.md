# Basic Banking System

This is my 1st task as a web development at the Sparks Foundation. I had to create a basic banking system. It had a dummy database and amount transfers had to be done within accounts already present.

Flow: Home Page > View all Customers > Select and View one Customer > Transfer Money > Select customer to transfer to > View all Customers 

Front End: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Back end: PHP

Database: MySQL (phpMyAdmin)
